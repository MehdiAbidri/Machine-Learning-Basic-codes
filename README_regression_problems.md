# Machine-Learning-Basic-codes
I put there some basic codes used in machine learning.  
All these codes are created as per the following steps: <br> 
1- Preparing the Dataset : <br> 
  The dataset is either automatically generated by sklearn or taken from real data. <br> 
2- Choosing and building the model:<br> 
  For the regression promblem the model chosen is the linear model and it depends on <br> 
  the relation between the target variable and the features.<br> 
3-Building a cost function: <br> 
  The cost function is the mean squared error. <br> 
4-Building a cost minimisation function : <br> 
  The minilisation function used is the gradient descent. <br>
5-Training the model : <br>
  This last step consits in minimizing the prediction error by using the gradient descent technique. <br>
  Here an Learning rate and number of iteration are given. <br>
