# Machine-Learning-Basic-codes
I put there some basic codes used in machine learning.  
All thses codes are created as per the following steps: 
1- Preparing the Dataset : 
  The dataset is either automatically generated by sklearn or taken from real data. 
2- Choosing and building the model:
  For the regression promblem we chose the linear ( or non linear) model and it depends on 
  the relation between the target variable and the features.
3-Building a cost function: 
  The cost function is the mean squared error
4-Building a cost minimisation function : 
  The minilisation function used is the gradient descent.
